      <p>Mindfulness is all about being present in the moment. Each time that you purposely bring your focus back to the present, you train your brain and mindfulness skills.</p>
      <p>A common meditation to train mindfulness is to focus on your breathing. Focal Point helps you focus on your breath by engaging multiple senses to reduce distraction. </p>
      <p>Press your mouse or tap your screen as you inhale. Let go during your exhale. Keep your focus on the present: your breath and the sights and sounds that accompany it.  </p>
